# GAN-Album-Cover
GANs for Album Cover Generation

> #### *Project is still on development stage*

### Summary
This project creates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for album cover generation based on the Spotify dataset. It is based on [this paper](https://ryanmcconville.com/publications/AlbumCoverGenerationFromGenreTags.pdf) and the ultimate objective is to generate album images based on music genres.

There will be some intermediate steps on the process: 1 - Generate a data set 2 - Create an album image GAN 3 - Create a GAN that generates albums based on genre

## Notes

 - **According to this [sourse](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-get-started-with-generative-adversarial-networks-7-day-mini-course/)** , there are seven best practices to consider when implementing your GAN model:

	1.  Downsample Using Strided Convolutions (e.g. donâ€™t use pooling layers)
	2.  Upsample Using Strided Convolutions (e.g. use the transpose convolutional layer).
	3.  Use LeakyReLU (e.g. donâ€™t use the standard ReLU).
	4.  Use Batch Normalization (e.g. standardize layer outputs after the activation).
	5.  Use Gaussian Weight Initialization (e.g. a mean of 0.0 and stdev of 0.02).
	6.  Use Adam Stochastic Gradient Descent (e.g. learning rate of 0.0002 and beta1 of 0.5).
	7.  Scale Images to the Range \[-1,1\] (e.g. use tanh in the output of the generator).

- Images from OMACIR dataset > Spotify dataset.
	- The authors of the [paper](https://ryanmcconville.com/publications/AlbumCoverGenerationFromGenreTags.pdf) initially downloaded the album covers from the OMACIR dataset and then found/downloaded the metadata of the albums from Spotify --> ~50k images
	- This project used the album images that were directly downloaded from Spotify --> ~30k images
