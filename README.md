# GAN-Album-Cover
GANs for Album Cover Generation

### Summary
This project creates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for album cover generation based on the Spotify dataset. It is based on [this paper](https://ryanmcconville.com/publications/AlbumCoverGenerationFromGenreTags.pdf) and the ultimate objective is to generate album images based on music genres.

There will be some intermediate steps on the process: 1 - Generate a data set 2 - Create a genre classifier 3 - Create an album image GAN 4 - Create a GAN that generates albums based on genre
